WARNING! dev mode is enabled! In this mode, Vault runs entirely in-memory
and starts unsealed with a single unseal key. The root token is already
authenticated to the CLI, so you can immediately begin using Vault.

You may need to set the following environment variable:

    $ export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'

The unseal key and root token are displayed below in case you want to
seal/unseal the Vault or re-authenticate.

Unseal Key: cOKNnuCL8kZJp+38CV/az/pbLRLxfjqBaK6+9E7nnCU=
Root Token: s.OoQBrbSBeAIlpFtoNfSAJvxX

Development mode should NOT be used in production installations!
